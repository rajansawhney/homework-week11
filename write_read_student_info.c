/*
I. Read and write in a file

Write a C program that gets all the members of an array of structures,
writes them to a text file named "hw11.txt", then reads the array
from the file and displays it on the screen.

Example:
Get student information:
Enter name: student1
Enter age: 22
.
.
.
Displaying student information:
Name: student1
Age: 24

Name: student2
Age: 21
.
.
.
Name: student5
Age: 30

Note:
- File "hw11.txt" must be created in the same directory as the program
- File "hw11.txt" must be created by your program (and not manually)
- Use struct with name and age as its variables
- Accept name (firstname only) and age for array of structs of size 5
- Display output as shown in the example above
